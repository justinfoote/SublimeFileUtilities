# SublimeFileUtilities


A simple Sublime Text 2 plugin that adds two commands to the command palette:

## Rename Current File

Prompts you for a new name for the current file, then renames it.  

## Delete Current File

Removes the currently open file from the disk.  It's left open in Sublime, 
though, so you can save it as something else.
